# Drum-Kit-


##This repository includes an HTML structure for a drum kit web page, along with CSS styling and a JavaScript section. The HTML defines buttons representing different drum sounds, a title, and a footer. The CSS file provides styles for the page elements, including background colors, fonts, and button appearances. The JavaScript code handles user interactions with the drum buttons, plays corresponding drum sounds, and adds animation effects when buttons are clicked or keys are pressed.

This Code is obtained when i was doing my web development course by angela
