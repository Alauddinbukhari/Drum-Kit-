# Drum Kit
This repository includes an HTML structure for a drum kit web page, along with CSS styling and a JavaScript section. The HTML defines buttons representing different drum sounds, a title, and a footer. The CSS file provides styles for the page elements, including background colors, fonts, and button appearances. The JavaScript code handles user interactions with the drum buttons, plays corresponding drum sounds, and adds animation effects when buttons are clicked or keys are pressed.

This code was obtained while completing a web development course by Angela Yu.

To try out the drum kit, simply open the index.html file in a web browser.

Enjoy playing the drums! ü•Å
